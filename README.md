# Welcome Home Game

This is my first attempt at learning object oriented programming. This game takes 
very simple code in Python to create classes of rooms, items, and characters. 
To gain key understanding of OOP, there are examples that include aggregation, 
inheiritance, and working with properties (along with getters/setters).

In this game, you start out coming into the entry way of a house and are able to
navigate through the home. The object to "win" the game is to just remove the two
intruders that have broken into your home. You are able to interact with the game in various ways, including picking up objects from the rooms (which you'll have to do to fight the intruders).
